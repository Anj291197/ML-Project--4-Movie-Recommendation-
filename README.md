# ML-Project--4-Movie-Recommendation-
Recommendation system for movies using cosine similarity and count vectorizer. 
Cosine similarity is a measure of how similar two vectors are, based on the angle between them.
Count vectorizer is a technique that converts text into numerical vectors, based on the frequency of words in the text.
By using these two methods, you can create a system that can recommend movies to users based on their preferences and ratings.
